# POC of app for searching github issues by label and language

This app can help you find issue by label and language.

It may be useful if you want to start contributing to open source, but can't find any simple issues.

For example you can choose `Javascript` lang and `good-first-issue` label and it will show you a list of issues.

# Motivation

1) I created it for myself in order to find issues to contribute
2) I created this project with modern stack because i will use this stack on the next project at work. So in general i think it is overkill to use these technologies for this tiny app

Stack:
* TypeScript
* Next.js
* Apollo
* Code generation for graphql
* Docker
* CircleCI
