# Small app for searching github issues by label and language

This app can help you find issues by label and language. It might be helpful if you are searching for issues to contribute to on GitHub. For example, you can choose the `JavaScript`` language and the `good-first-issue`` label, and it will show you a list of issues with that label.

# Motivation

1. I created it for myself in order to find issues to contribute
2. I created this project with modern stack because i will use this stack on the next project at work.

# Stack:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- React Query
- Code generation for graphql
- Github Actions
